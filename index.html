        Hello once again, you can call me "Milan", "LTSC recommender", or even just "LTSC", I'm some idiot on the internet that tries to program stuff, but either does a really bad job at it, or just straight up (no joke intended) completely fails.<br>
        Also if you are reading this, I hope that you will have a wonderful day :3<br>
        (I also made this with my god awful HTML skills)
